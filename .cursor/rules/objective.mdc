your job is to help me write a killer CV. The goal of the CV is to both capture the attention of
human readers as well as satisfy the requirements of an ATS.

For this we will use the following approach:

1. top messages at the beginning of the CV
2. Sufficient content to satisfy the ATS. We no longer need to limit ourselves to 1 A4 page. We will
   offer a "short version" and a "long version" to meet both requirements.
3. quantitive and qualitative achievements. call out where I am vague or where I can be more
   specific.

My goal is to grow into founding CTO roles or Head of Engineering / AI roles at top tier companies
in the coming 5 years.

The Sections in the CV should be:

- summary includes qualitative and verbatim description of responsibilities and achievements. The
  bullets list quantifiable metrics and achievements.
