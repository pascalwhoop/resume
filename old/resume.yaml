  summary: |
    A computer scientist by background, I have broad technical skills in engineering
    software & data systems, linux environments and in the cloud. I have served numerous
    clients in a large range of industries and can therefore offer a wide range of
    solutions to complex problems.
    
    Professionally, my topics of interest are:
    Biotech, Medtech and mineral based carbon capturing. 

    Personally, I am interested in longevity and mindfullness. 

    I adhere to a principle that I was taught at Data Minded: You know nothing until you
    deploy to production. Following this principle, I prefer to leverage the simplest
    technology to create value immidiately and iterate from there. This may mean that the
    first ETL pipeline is an `rsync` script and a `cron` job. But if it can be done in 4
    hours, you provide value to your user instantly and begin the learning cycle.
