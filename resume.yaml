  summary: |
    <p>
    With a background in computer science, I possess extensive technical expertise in
    software and data systems engineering, Linux, and cloud environments. Building on
    this, I have led teams of up to 20 members in both client engagements and internal
    projects at McKinsey, serving clients across Europe, North America, and Asia in
    industries such as banking, healthcare, biotech, energy, and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
    My industrial focus areas are carbon capture, biotechnology, and material sciences.
    I dedicate my personal time to exploring longevity, mindfulness, maintaining regular
    exercise, and working on my homelab.
    </p>
    <p>
    Guided by the principle that learning comes from action, I encourage product teams to
    release early and frequently, using user feedback for iterative improvement.
